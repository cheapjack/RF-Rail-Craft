The **mouse wheel** (if you have one) can be used to select items in your Toolbar.

If your inventory window is open, pressing 1–9 will add whatever item your mouse is over to that slot on your Toolbar.


### Behaviour

#### Too much fun doesnt work on RPI-RailCraft! We here to celebrate Railways so you need to play in a different way! Each station will show you how! But generally **please** do not behave like privatised services think & behave like a nationalised minecraft union:

 * Be nice!
 * No Lava!
 * No TNT! Its banned
 * No arrows!
 * No PVP!
 * Rail Infrastructure jokes only in the terminal!
**You will be kicked** if you become **disruptive**! Train disruptions make for angry passengers! (if only the shareholders cared)
