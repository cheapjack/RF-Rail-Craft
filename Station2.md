### Building carriages project **Station 2**

4 Pi Minecraft Games for players to build on carriage chassis ‘templates’ based on images of the early Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR)

1 monitor and RPi visualises the train as moving, using a fixed camera entity traversing from front to back of the train

 * Look at some of the image reference of Railway carriages 
 * Build your own version of the train and carriages
 * Watch the train go by as we all build it together
